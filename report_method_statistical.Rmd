## Statistical methods
o Discuss primary objective(s) of the project.
o The method used. Here, you can talk about the non-parametric, semi-parametric or
parametric methods as applied in your report. Remember to provide some details on these methods. Mentioning them by name is inadequate. Use any reference (published
papers, book) provided they are cited appropriately.
o Discuss applicable assumptions. Does your model have proportional hazard
assumption? What kind of censoring does your data have and what assumption is
applicable here? How do you check if these assumptions are met?
o Include relevant formulas for selected method(s) if applicable.
