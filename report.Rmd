# Abstract

o Briefly discuss the research problem and how this report addresses that problem.
o If possible, mention the main results.

# Background and Objectives
<<<<<<< HEAD

Research Question:
How effective are hormonal and chemotherapy treatments in improving survival rates?

o While this section is project-dependent, remember to include enough information so
that the reader knows what your project is about. Briefly discuss the substantive field
citing relevant papers where applicable.

Provide an overview of the subject area and context for the study.
Discuss the importance and relevance of the research.
Summarize the existing literature and how this study contributes to the field.
Clearly state the aims of the study.
Identify the specific questions or hypotheses the study addresses.
Explain the significance of the analyses being performed (Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards model, and proportional hazards checking).



## Study data
o Discuss study data in prose form. Here, you can talk about the study population, total
sample size, the baseline characteristics, the primary outcome/endpoint, type of
censoring etc.
o Include well tabulated and annotated summary statistics of the baseline
characteristics.
o Missing data and how it was dealt with if applicable.

Describe the dataset used, including the source, the number of observations, and any relevant demographics or clinical characteristics of the subjects.
Summarize key statistical features of the data, such as distributions of main variables, missing data, and potential outliers.
Include visualizations such as histograms, box plots, or scatter plots to show distributions and relationships between variables.
Report any preliminary findings or patterns observed that motivated further analysis.


## Statistical methods
o Discuss primary objective(s) of the project.
o The method used. Here, you can talk about the non-parametric, semi-parametric or
parametric methods as applied in your report. Remember to provide some details on these methods. Mentioning them by name is inadequate. Use any reference (published
papers, book) provided they are cited appropriately.
o Discuss applicable assumptions. Does your model have proportional hazard
assumption? What kind of censoring does your data have and what assumption is
applicable here? How do you check if these assumptions are met?
o Include relevant formulas for selected method(s) if applicable.


Outline the statistical methods and models used in the study, including Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards modeling.
Explain the rationale for choosing these methods and how they contribute to the study objectives.
Detail the procedures for checking the proportional hazards assumption, including any graphical methods (like Schoenfeld residual plots) or statistical tests used.
Discuss any data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing data or transforming variables.



# Results
<<<<<<< HEAD

o Talk about the study results in prose form making sure to include appropriate tables
and figures. No interpretation at this stage.
o Things to consider include hazard ratio, p-values, median survival times, relevant
confidence intervals, log-rank test(s). Remember to mention selected significance
level (0.05, 0.01 etc).


Present the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and interpret the survival functions for different groups within the dataset.
Report the results of the log-rank test, including the test statistic and p-value, and what they suggest about differences in survival between groups.
Summarize the findings from the Cox proportional hazards model, including the estimated coefficients, hazard ratios, confidence intervals, and significance levels.
Discuss the results of the proportional hazards assumption checks and any actions taken if violations were detected.



# Discussion 

o Briefly reiterate the study population, objective(s) and the primary outcome.
o Discuss the results as presented in previous section. Here, you can provide
interpretation as appropriate.
o Mention any limitations if there and how that might affect the interpretation of the
study results.

Interpret the results in the context of the research question and objectives.
Compare the findings with existing literature and theories.
Discuss the potential implications of the findings for clinical practice or future research.
Acknowledge the limitations of the study, such as potential confounding factors, sample size, or generalizability issues.
Address any unexpected results or discrepancies with previous research.
